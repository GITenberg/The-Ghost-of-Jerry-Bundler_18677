<h2>THE GHOST OF JERRY BUNDLER.</h2>
<hr style="width: 25%;" />


<p class="sd"><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;The Commercial Room in an old-fashioned
hotel in a small country town. An air of old-fashioned
comfort is in evidence everywhere. Old sporting prints
on the walls.</p>

<p class="sd">On the table up <span class="loc">C.</span> are half a dozen candlesticks, old-fashioned
shape with snuffer attached. Two pairs of carpet
slippers are set up within fender. Red curtains to
window recess. Shutters or blinds to windows. Armchair
and about six other chairs in the room. One
old-fashioned settle. One small table. Clock. Decanter
of water, half a dozen toddy tumblers. Matches,
etc. The only light is a ruddy glow from the fire. Kettle
on hob. Moonlight from <span class="loc">R.</span> of window when shutter
is opened. Practical chandelier from ceiling or lights
at side of mantelpiece. <span class="spkr">Doctor's</span> coat and muffler on
chair up <span class="loc">L.</span>, his cap on mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="sd">All lights out, dark stage. Opening music. Curtain
rise&mdash;ticking of clock heard. Wind, then church clock
chimes, the Lights come very slowly up, when the red
glow is seen in the fireplace the low murmurs of the
characters heard, and gradually get louder as lights
come up to when <span class="spkr">Somers'</span> voice tops all.</p>

<p class="sd">(The stage occupied by all characters except <span class="spkr">George</span> the
waiter. Discovered, <span class="spkr">Penfold</span>, sitting in arm chair <span class="loc">L.</span>
of fire, above it. <span class="spkr">Doctor Leek</span> standing above fire
and leaning on mantel-shelf. <span class="spkr">Hirst</span> sitting on settle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
below fire and nearest to audience. <span class="spkr">Somers</span> seated on
settle with him but above him. <span class="spkr">Malcolm</span> and <span class="spkr">Beldon</span>
on chairs <span class="loc">R. C.</span>, facing fire. <span class="spkr">All</span> are smoking,
and drink from their respective glasses from time to
time. <span class="spkr">Somers</span> has just finished a story as Curtain
rises.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Omnes.</span> Oh, I say, that sounds impossible, etc.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> Haunted or not haunted, the fact remains
that no one stays in the house long. It's been let to
several tenants since the time of the murder, but they
never completed their tenancy. The last tenant held
out for a month, but at last he gave up like the rest,
and cleared out, although he had done the place up
thoroughly, and must have been pounds out of pocket
by the transaction.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> Well, it's a capital ghost story, I admit,
that is, as a story, but I for one can't swallow it.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst.</span> I don't know, it is not nearly so improbable
as some I have heard. Of course it's an old
idea that spirits like to get into the company of human
beings. A man told me once, that he travelled down
by the Great Western, with a ghost as fellow passenger,
and hadn't the slightest suspicion of it, until the inspector
came for tickets. My friend said, the way that
ghost tried to keep up appearances, by feeling in all its
pockets, and even looking on the floor for its ticket,
was quite touching. Ultimately it gave it up, and with
a loud groan vanished through the ventilator.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Somers</span>, <span class="spkr">Malcolm</span> and <span class="spkr">Leek</span> laugh heartily.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> Oh, I say come now, that'll do.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold</span> <span class="isd">(seriously)</span>. Personally I don't think it's
a subject for jesting. I have never seen an apparition
myself, but I have known people who have, and I consider
that they form a very interesting link between us
and the after life. There's a ghost story connected
with this house, you know.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><span class="spkr">Omnes.</span> Eh! Oh? Really!</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm</span> <span class="isd">(rising and going to mantelpiece, takes up
his glass of toddy)</span>. Well, I have used this house for
some years now. I travel for Blennet and Burgess&mdash;wool&mdash;and
come here regularly three times a year, and
I've never heard of it. <span class="isd">(Sits down again on his chair,
holding glass in his hand.)</span></p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> And I've been here pretty often too, though
I have only been in practice here for a couple of years,
and I have never heard it mentioned, and I must say I
don't believe in anything of the sort. In my opinion
ghosts are the invention of weak-minded idiots.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> Weak-minded idiots or not, there is a
ghost story connected with this house, but it dates a
long time back.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span>, the waiter, enters <span class="loc">D. L.</span> with tray and
serviette.)</p>

<p>Oh, here's George, he'll bear me out. You've heard of
Jerry Bundler, George?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George</span> <span class="isd">(<span class="loc">C.</span>)</span>. Well, I've just 'eard odds and ends,
sir, but I never put much count to 'em. There was
one chap 'ere, who was under me when fust I come, he
said he seed it, and the Guv'nor sacked him there and
then. <span class="isd">(Goes to table by window, puts tray down, takes
up glass and wipes it slowly.)</span></p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Men</span> laugh.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> Well, my father was a native of this
town, and he knew the story well. He was a truthful
man and a steady churchgoer. But I have heard him
declare that once in his life he saw the ghost of Jerry
Bundler in this house; let me see, George, you don't
remember my old dad, do you?</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> puts down glasses over table.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> No, sir. I come here forty years ago
next Easter, but I fancy he was before my time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> Yes, though not by long. He died when
I was twenty, and I shall be sixty-two next month, but
that's neither here nor there.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> goes up to table <span class="loc">C.</span> tidying up and listening.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> Who was this Jerry Bundler?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> A London thief, pickpocket, highwayman&mdash;anything
he could turn his dishonest hand to,
and he was run to earth in this house some eighty
years ago.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> puts glass down and stands listening.)</p>

<p>He took his last supper in this room.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Penfold</span> leans forward. <span class="spkr">Beldon</span> looks round to
<span class="loc">L.</span> nervously.)</p>

<p>That night soon after he had gone to bed, a couple of
Bow Street runners, the predecessors of our present
detective force turned up here. They had followed
him from London, but had lost scent a bit, so didn't
arrive till late. A word to the landlord, whose description
of the stranger who had retired to rest, pointed to
the fact that he was the man they were after, of course
enlisted his aid and that of the male servants and
stable hands. The officers crept quietly up to Jerry's
bedroom and tried the door, it wouldn't budge. It was
of heavy oak and bolted from within.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Omnes</span> lean forward, showing interest.)</p>

<p>Leaving his comrade and a couple of grooms to guard
the bedroom door, the other officer went into the yard,
and, procuring a short ladder, by this means reached
the window of the room in which Jerry was sleeping.
The Inn servants and stable hands saw him get on to
the sill and try to open the window. Suddenly there
was a crash of glass, and with a cry, he fell in a heap
on to the stones at their feet. Then in the moonlight,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
they saw the face of the highwayman peering over the
sill.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Omnes</span> move uneasily.)</p>

<p>They sent for the blacksmith, and with his sledge-hammer
he battered in the strong oak panels, and the first
thing that met their eyes was the body of Jerry Bundler
dangling from the top of the four-post bed by his own
handkerchief.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Omnes</span> sit back, draw their breath, and are generally
uneasy. Slight pause.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> I say, which bedroom was it? <span class="isd">(Earnestly)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> That I can't tell you, but the story goes
that Jerry still haunts this house, and my father used to
declare positively that the last time he slept here, the
ghost of Jerry Bundler lowered itself from the top of
his four-post bed and tried to strangle him.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon</span> <span class="isd">(jumps up, gets behind his chair, twists
chair round; nervously)</span>. O, I say, that'll do. I wish
you'd thought to ask your father which bedroom it
was.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> What for?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> Well, I should take jolly good care not
to sleep in it, that's all. <span class="isd">(Goes to back.)</span></p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Penfold</span> rising, goes to fire, and knocks out his pipe,
Leek gets by arm-chair.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> There's nothing to fear. I don't believe
for a moment that ghosts could really hurt one.
<span class="isd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> lights candle at table.)</span> In fact, my father
used to say that it was only the unpleasantness of the
thing that upset him, and that, for all practical purposes,
Jerry's fingers might have been made of cotton
wool for all the harm they could do.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> hands candle, gets to door and holds it open.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> That's all very fine, a ghost story is a
ghost story, but when a gentleman tells a tale of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
ghost that haunts the house in which one is going to
sleep, I call it most ungentlemanly.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Beldon</span> places his chair to <span class="loc">L.</span> of table <span class="loc">R.</span> <span class="spkr">Penfold</span> goes
up to <span class="loc">C.</span> <span class="spkr">Leek</span> sits in arm chair. <span class="spkr">Beldon</span> goes to
fireplace.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> Pooh! Nonsense. <span class="isd">(At table up <span class="loc">C.</span>)</span>.</p>

<p class="sd">(During his speech George lights one of the candles.)</p>

<p>Ghosts can't hurt you. For my own part, I should
rather like to see one.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Omnes.</span> Oh, come now&mdash;&mdash; etc.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Penfold.</span> Well, I'll bid you good-night, gentlemen.</p>

<p class="sd">(He goes towards door <span class="loc">L.</span> <span class="spkr">George</span> opens it for him; he
passes out as they all say.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Omnes.</span> Good-night.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Hirst</span> rises, crosses to <span class="loc">L. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon</span> <span class="isd">(up <span class="loc">R.</span>, calling after him)</span>. And I hope
Jerry'll pay you a visit.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm</span> <span class="isd">(rises, goes to fire)</span>. Well, I'm going to
have another whisky if you gentlemen will join me. I
think it'll do us all good after that tale. George, take
the orders.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> comes down with salver to table <span class="loc">R.</span>, gathers up
glasses.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> Not quite so much hot water in mine.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> I'll have the same again, George.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> A leetle bit of lemon in mine, George.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> Whisky and soda for me, please.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst.</span> Whisky!</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> goes to table <span class="loc">R.</span>, collects glasses, crosses to door
<span class="loc">L.</span> speaks.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George</span> <span class="isd">(to <span class="spkr">Malcolm</span>)</span>. Shall I light the gas, Mr.
Malcolm? <span class="isd">(At door.)</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> No, the fire's very comfortable, unless
any of you gentlemen prefer the gas.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Omnes.</span> No, not at all&mdash;etc.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> Never mind, George. <span class="isd">(This to <span class="spkr">George</span>
as no one wants the gas.)</span> The firelight is pleasanter.</p>

<p class="sd">(Exit <span class="spkr">George</span> for orders <span class="loc">L.</span>)</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Beldon</span> gets <span class="loc">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm</span> <span class="isd">(at fire)</span>. Does any gentleman know
another&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers</span> <span class="isd">(seated <span class="loc">R.</span>)</span>. Well, I remember hearing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon</span> <span class="isd">(up <span class="loc">C.</span>)</span>. Oh, I say&mdash;that'll do.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Omnes</span> laugh.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> Yes, I think you all look as if you'd heard
enough ghost stories to do you the rest of your lives.
And you're not all as anxious to see the real article as
the old gentleman who's just gone.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst</span> <span class="isd">(looking to <span class="loc">L.</span>)</span>. Old humbug! I should

I dress up as Jerry Bundler and go and give him a
chance of displaying his courage? I bet I'd make the
old party sit up.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> Capital!</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> A good idea.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> I shouldn't, if I were you.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst.</span> Just for the joke, gentlemen <span class="isd">(<span class="loc">C.</span>)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> No, no&mdash;drop it, Hirst.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst.</span> Only for the joke. Look here, I've got
some things that'll do very well. We're going to have
some amateur theatricals at my house. We're doing a
couple of scenes from "The Rivals," Somers, <span class="isd">(pointing
to <span class="spkr">Somers</span>)</span> and I have been up to town to get the
costumes, wigs, etc., to-day. I've got them up-stairs&mdash;knee-breeches,
stockings, buckled shoes, and all that
sort of thing. It's a rare chance. If you wait a bit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I'll give you a full dress rehearsal, entitled "Jerry
Bundler, or the Nocturnal Stranger." <span class="isd">(At door <span class="loc">L.</span>)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek</span> <span class="isd">(sneeringly)</span>. You won't frighten us, will
you?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst.</span> I don't know so much about that&mdash;it's a
question of acting, that's all.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> I'll bet you a level sov, you don't
frighten me.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst</span> <span class="isd">(quietly)</span>. A level sov. <span class="isd">(Pauses.)</span> Done.
I'll take the bet to frighten you first, and the old boy
afterwards. These gentlemen shall be the judges.
<span class="isd">(Points to <span class="spkr">Leek</span> and <span class="spkr">Beldon</span>.)</span></p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon</span> <span class="isd">(up <span class="loc">C.</span>)</span>. You won't frighten us because
we're prepared for you, but you'd better leave the old
man alone. It's dangerous play. <span class="isd">(Appeals to <span class="spkr">Leek</span>)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst.</span> Well, I'll try you first. <span class="isd">(Moves to door and
pauses.)</span> No gas, mind.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Omnes.</span> No! no!</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst</span> <span class="isd">(laughs)</span>. I'll give you a run for your
money.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> enters, holds door open.)</p>

<p class="sd">(Exit <span class="spkr">Hirst</span>.)</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> passes drinks round. Five drinks. <span class="spkr">Somers</span>

table <span class="loc">R.</span> <span class="spkr">Beldon</span> sits <span class="loc">R. C.</span> <span class="spkr">George</span> crosses to table,
puts two drinks down, goes to fire and gives drinks,
then up to table, puts tray down, takes up glass and
begins to wipe it, gets down <span class="loc">L.</span> for lines.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek</span> <span class="isd">(to <span class="spkr">Malcolm</span>)</span>. I think you'll win your bet,
sir, but I vote we give him a chance. Suppose we
have cigars round, and if he's not back by the time
we've finished them I must be off, as I have a quarter
of an hour's walk before me. <span class="isd">(Looks at watch.)</span> He's
a friend of yours, isn't he?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> Yes, I have known him a good many
years now, and I must say he's a rum chap; just crazy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
about acting and practical joking, though I've often
told him he carries the latter too far at times. In this
case it doesn't matter, but I won't let him try it on the
<i>old gentleman</i>. You see we know what he's going to
do, and are prepared, but he doesn't, and it might lead
to illness or worse; the old chap's sixty-two and such
a shock might have serious consequences. But Hirst
won't mind giving up that part of it, so long as he gets
an opportunity of acting to us.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek</span> <span class="isd">(knocks pipe on grate)</span>. Well, I hope he'll
hurry up. It's getting pretty late. <span class="isd">(To <span class="spkr">Somers</span>.)</span></p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> Well, gentlemen, your health!</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> Good luck.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> Hurrah!</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> Chin-chin!</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> By the way, how is it you happen to be
here to-night?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> Oh, we missed the connection at Tolleston
Junction and as the accommodation at the Railway
Arms there was rather meagre, the Station Master advised
us to drive on here, put up for the night, and
catch the Great Northern express from Exton in the
morning. <span class="isd">(Rises, crosses to <span class="loc">L.</span>)</span> Oh, George, that
reminds me&mdash;you might see that 'Boots' calls us at 7

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">Beldon</span> rises, goes up to them to fire.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> Certainly, sir. What are your numbers?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> 13 and 14.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> I'll put it on the slate, special, sir. <span class="isd">(Goes
to door <span class="loc">L.</span>)</span></p>

<p><span class="spkr">Leek.</span> I beg pardon, gentlemen, I forgot the cigars;
George, bring some cigars back with you.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> A very mild one for me.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> Very well, sir. <span class="isd">(Takes up tray from sideboard.)</span></p>

<p class="sd">(Exit <span class="loc">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> I think you were very wise coming on
here. <span class="isd">(Sits on settle <span class="loc">R.</span>)</span> I stayed at the Railway
Arms, Tolleston, once&mdash;never again though. Is your
friend clever at acting?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Somers.</span> I don't think he's clever enough to frighten
you. I'm to spend Christmas at his place, and he's
asked me to assist at the theatricals he spoke of.
Nothing would satisfy him till I consented, and I
must honestly say I am very sorry I ever did, for I
expect I shall be pretty bad. I know I have scarcely
slept a wink these last few nights, trying to get the
words into my head.</p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">George</span> enters backwards, pale and trembling.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> Why, you're frightened, George.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> Yes, sir. It was the suddenness of it,
and besides I didn't look for seeing it in the bar.
There was only a glimmer of light there, and it was
sitting on the floor. I nearly touched it.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm</span> <span class="isd">(goes to door, looks off, then returns&mdash;to
others)</span>. It must be Hirst up to his tricks. George
was out of the room when he suggested it. <span class="isd">(To
<span class="spkr">George</span>.)</span> Pull yourself together, man.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> Yes, sir&mdash;but it took me unawares. I'd

it ain't indeed. It's got the awfullest deathlike
face, and short cropped red hair&mdash;it's&mdash;</p>

<p class="sd">(Smothered cry is heard.)</p>

<p>What's that? <span class="isd">(Backs to <span class="loc">C</span> and leans on chair.)</span></p>

<p class="sd">(<span class="spkr">All</span> start, and a quick pattering of footsteps is heard
rapidly approaching the room. The door flies open

only his trousers and shirt on, his face very white
with fear and his own hair all standing on end.
<span class="spkr">Leek</span> lights the gas, then goes to <span class="loc">R.</span> of <span class="spkr">Hirst</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Omnes.</span> What's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> Why, it's Hirst.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm</span> <span class="isd">(uneasily)</span>. Rot!</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst.</span> I was coming down the stairs to get something

<p><span class="spkr">Hirst</span> <span class="isd">(<span class="loc">C.</span>)</span>. I turned and saw it&mdash;a little wicked

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> I leave to-morrow. I wouldn't go down

a tough lot round here, and one never knows
what might happen, so I have been accustomed to
carry it. I just pulled it out so as to have it handy.
I meant to have a pot at that ghost if I had seen him.
There's no law against it, is there? I never heard of
a close time for ghosts.</p>

George here would be glad to be allowed to make up a
bed on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Beldon.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="spkr">Malcolm.</span> Well, that's settled. A majority of three

<p><span class="spkr">George.</span> Thank you, sir. And if you gentlemen

in dark breeches, white stockings, buckled shoes,
white shirt, very neat in every detail, with a long white

sunken eyes and a leering smile, and close cropped red
hair. The figure blinks at the candle, then slowly
raises its hands and unties the handkerchief, its head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>

<h2><i>MARY'S ANKLE</i></h2>


<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By May Tully. Produced originally
at the Bijou Theatre, New York. 6 males, 4 females. 1 interior,
1 exterior scene. Modern costumes.</p>

<p class="adsp">This brisk and peppery farce is one of the cleanest and most hilariously
amusing plays of recent years. It is the story of ambitious but
impecunious youth. "Doc" Hampton, without a patient, "Stocksie,"
a lawyer devoid of clients, and "Chub" Perkins, a financier without
capital, are in a bad way. In fact, they are broke and it is a real
problem for them actually to get food. Mary Jane Smith is the
heroine with the ankle. The three pals meet her first as a solicitor of
funds for the poor and again as the victim of an automobile accident.</p>

<p>A rich relative, "Doc's" uncle, inclined to be a tightwad but good
at heart, comes upon the scene and seeing Mary, immediately takes it
for granted that she is his nephew's wife, having been informed by
a bogus wedding invitation that the ceremony had just taken place.
The fictitious wedding had been arranged by the boys in a moment
of need in order to get "Doc's" family in the West to send on wedding
presents that could be pawned. As his wedding present, the
Uncle insists that "Doc" and Mary accompany him to Bermuda. The
situation is tense, but Mary has a sense of humor, and saves the day.</p>

<h2><i>WILD WAVES</i></h2>


<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By William Ford Manley. Produced
originally at the Times Square Theatre, New York.
30 males, 15 females. 4 interior scenes. Modern costumes.</p>

<p class="adsp">A rollicking farce about what transpires behind the microphone of
a broadcasting studio. The most popular singing artist in Station
WWVW is Roy Denny. Through some mischance it comes about that
the Denny "golden voice" is really John Duffy. Duffy, being a
nervous lad, has always failed miserably from microphone fright
whenever he has attempted to sing under his own name. When he
croons under Denny's name he kindles the divine hope in female
breasts clear across this palpitating country. But Denny receives all
the credit. This hoax destroys Duffy's personal love life and results
in a conspiracy inside Station WWVW. As a sort of undercurrent to
the narrative it introduces satiric bits about the buncombe of radio
broadcasting. The play offers fine opportunities for the introduction
of musical numbers and comedy acts.</p>

<h2><i>THE MIDDLE WATCH</i></h2>


<p>A farcical comedy in 3 acts. By Ian Hay and Stephen
King-Hall. Produced originally at the Times Square
Theatre, New York. 9 males, 6 females. Modern costumes
and naval uniforms. 2 interior scenes.</p>

<p class="adsp">During a reception on board H. M. S. "Falcon," a cruiser on the
China Station, Captain Randall of the Marines has become engaged to
Fay Eaton, and in his enthusiasm induces her to stay and have dinner
in his cabin. This is met with stern disapproval by Fay's chaperon,
Charlotte Hopkinson, who insists that they leave at once. Charlotte,
however, gets shut up in the compass room, and a gay young American
widow accepts the offer to take her place, both girls intending
to go back to shore in the late evening. Of course, things go wrong,
and they have to remain aboard all night. By this time the Captain
has to be told, because his cabin contains the only possible accommodations,
and he enters into the conspiracy without signalling the Admiral's
flagship. Then the "Falcon" is suddenly ordered to sea, and
the Admiral decides to sail with her. This also makes necessary the
turning over to him of the Captain's quarters. The presence of the
ladies now becomes positively embarrassing. The girls are bundled into
one cabin just opposite that occupied by the Admiral. The game of
"general-post" with a marine sentry in stockinged feet is very funny,
and so are the attempts to explain matters to the "Old Man" next
morning. After this everything ends both romantically and happily.</p>

<h2><i>NANCY'S PRIVATE AFFAIR</i></h2>


<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By Myron C. Fagan. Produced
originally at the Vanderbilt Theatre, New York. 4 males,
5 females. 2 interior scenes. Modern costumes.</p>

<p class="adsp">Nothing is really private any more&mdash;not even pajamas and bedtime
stories. No one will object to Nancy's private affair being made public,
and it would be impossible to interest the theatre public in a more
ingenious plot. Nancy is one of those smart, sophisticated society
women who wants to win back her husband from a baby vamp. Just
how this is accomplished makes for an exceptionally pleasant evening.
Laying aside her horn-rimmed spectacles, she pretends indifference and
affects a mysterious interest in other men. Nancy baits her rival with
a bogus diamond ring, makes love to her former husband's best friend,
and finally tricks the dastardly rival into a marriage with someone
else.</p>

<p>Mr. Fagan has studded his story with jokes and retorts that will
keep any audience in a constant uproar.</p>

<p class="adsp">(Royalty, twenty-five dollars.) <span class="smcap">Price 75 Cents</span>.</p>

<h2><i>TAKE MY TIP</i></h2>


<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By Nat N. Dorfman. Produced
originally at the 48th Street Theatre in New York.
7 males, 6 females. 1 interior scene. Modern costumes.</p>

<p class="adsp">Few of us have escaped getting our fingers burnt in the crash of
the stock market, and even those of us who have, have heard enough
about it to take a sympathetic and amused interest in the doings of
Henry Merrill when he tries to buck the game and grow rich. The
play starts just two months before the crash. Henry, of the local
soap works, is so heavy an investor in an oil stock that he is made
a thirty-sixth Vice President of the Corporation. Not being the kind
of fellow who would forget his friends in this time of good fortune,
he lets them all in on the good thing. Being humanly greedy, the
friends jump at the chance to profit.... In the second act, after
Henry's daughter has eloped, the friends are presenting Henry with
a diamond-studded wrist watch, as a token of their esteem, when
news comes of the Wall Street upheaval and all are wiped out. Things,
however, are not as bad as they look, for Henry, who has an invention
to revolutionize the soap industry, sells the idea for a large price and
everything is all right again.</p>

<h2><i>PETER FLIES HIGH</i></h2>


<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By Myron C. Fagan. Produced
originally at the Gaiety Theatre, New York. 8 males, 6
females. 1 interior scene. Modern costumes.</p>

<p class="adsp">This delightful comedy concerns one Peter Turner who caddied
for the Morgans, the Kahns and the Guggenheims on the links at
Miami. It was during one of these rounds on the golf links that
Peter fell over and killed a stray dog. The local paper built the story
up so that Peter becomes a nation-wide hero who saved the lives of
many people by strangling a mad canine. By the time the story
reaches his home town, Rosedale, New Jersey, Peter has become the
boon companion of all the money kings&mdash;at least in the public mind&mdash;and
Peter does his best to foster the deception. Carried away by
his imagination he pretends to be a friend of the great, persuades his
brother-in-law to buy an option to a ninety-acre lot on the assumption
that "Guggenheim" is to build a golf course there, obtains
$10,000 from the local banker and then becomes badly involved in his
deceptions. After Peter endures the ridicule of his townsfolk and
the ire of the banker there suddenly appears on the scene a representative
of "Guggenheim" who wants the acreage not for a golf course
but an air field, and promptly turns over a check for $75,000 for
a part of it.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
